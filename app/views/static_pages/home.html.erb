<h1>Norwich Counselling Group</h1>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
	Norwich Counselling Group is made up of four independent practitioners: Darran Biles, Kaz Lever, Camilla Nowell and Duncan Yuile. Below you will find individual biographies of each of us.
</p>
<p>
	We have all worked at the University of East Anglia’s (UEA) Counselling Service and at the Norwich Centre for Personal & Professional Development. We have now come together to offer a private counselling service in the heart of Norwich. All of us trained on UEA’s Postgraduate Diploma in Counselling – a Person-Centred training course established and developed by the renowned counsellor and psychotherapist Brian Thorne.
</p>
<p>
	We are all members of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and abide by its code of ethics.
